# Smart Air Monitoring System - SQL Schema

This repository contains the SQL schema for the Smart Air Monitoring System project, which uses gas and humidity sensors to monitor environmental conditions.

## Tables

- **Sensors**: Stores basic information about each sensor.
- **GasSensorData**: Stores gas level readings.
- **HumiditySensorData**: Stores humidity and temperature readings.

## How to Use

1. Run the `schema.sql` script to create the necessary tables in your database.
2. Insert data into the tables as needed.
3. Use SQL queries to interact with the data.

# Sample Data for Smart Air Monitoring System

This section contains sample data for the **Smart Air Monitoring System** project, which uses gas and humidity sensors to monitor environmental conditions.

## Data Overview

- **Sensors Table**: Includes entries for various sensors with their names, types, and statuses.
- **GasSensorData Table**: Contains sample readings for gas levels from different gas sensors.
- **HumiditySensorData Table**: Includes sample readings for humidity and temperature from different humidity sensors.

The data provides an example of how the system can be populated and used for testing and demonstration purposes.
